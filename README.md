# BridgIt
This project was one of my assignments at Northeastern University.

BridgIt is a 2 player game where players compete to connect their squares to the other side. 

To make a move, click on a white space on the board to place your colored square. 

Magenta moves first and then pink will follow. 

The game heavily favors the starting player and they should always win if played optimally. 

Enjoy.
